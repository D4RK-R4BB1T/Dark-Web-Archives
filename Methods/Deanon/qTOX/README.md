# Ransomware 

I've done this with a new variant of Ransomware It's unnamed but dude didn't even use a VPN, Leading me to his doorstep in Centeral Ukraine. This is a walk through for social engineering attempts.


"Prove it works" Method: Simple Method, Send me a video but I don't click links, or alternatively they may give you login credentials (How I obtained NoEscape Credentials lmao). Act like you wanna become an affiliate but need to ensure it works.


The "I can't click links due to New IT Policy but I need you to decrypt a few files because I'm not sure you're being honest and might not give the key" - If they want money they'll be offering up that 1-3 files decrypted won't they? If sent through qTox it'll be pretty obvious with dark mode as Yellow Traffic bar = Origin of Transfer.


Be creative and don't use the same phrases here.
