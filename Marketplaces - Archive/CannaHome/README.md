# CannaHome

According to the hacker "YosmiteIsNotRight" he managed to hack CannaHome a once popular Cannabis and Psychodelic Mushrooms market that has recently shut down. He stole the Database, sourcecode and etc. Although the database is lost to time it seems, We'll recover it if possible in due time. However he held the private keys of vendors at ransom. It's unknown if they were paid to be returned or reset by marketplace admins. The Specified amount is also unknown as is the number of effected accounts


Here's a release of the source code & Possible DB. Private Keys are long gone if still around.
