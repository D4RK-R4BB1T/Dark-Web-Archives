# Lockbit's US Businesse

 Without saying what one lockbit uses you should be able to follow the old methods of how Cartels setup up money laundering outposts specfically those in Southern Texas & Florida this should narrow your searches down

1. No Cards, Cash Only
2. Higher End
3. Think "White" Ran businesses because new york is fucking racist... So, Assume no white dude running a sushi bar.
4. High Traffic Areas: Near the bay, Near down town etc.
5. Bought out, Sold somewhere after 2016/2017
6. Hasn't done their taxes
7. The legal company who assisted them is new or considered a shark
8. Look for patterns, if X Company who assisted them has a bunch of seemingly odd clients it's more than likely a corrupt legal agency 
9. Out of State Legal Company (This isn't uncommon)
10. Strange Behavior lack of a Social Media/Website presence (Advertising = More Customers, More Customers = the IRS sniffing about so think less).
11. Remember this survived the pandemic & should be considered strange
12. Your owners aren't your target they're just the faces who cover up the activiites going on.
