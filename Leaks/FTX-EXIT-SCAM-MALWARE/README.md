# FTX-EXIT-SCAM-MALWARE
Malware being pushed by FTX Cryptocurrency Exchange Update Service. Malware was created November 12th, 2022 at 5:58 AM +0000 and is used as a smoke and Mirrors tactic


TO GIVE FULL CONTEXT:
1. The malware has been up for under 2hrs at the time of publishing this backup.
2. The orginal script can be found here: https://except.github.io/diff.html & A backed up archive can be found here: https://archive.ph/ryYAB
3. Reports of unauthoried movement of funds can be heard on r/CryptoCurrency around 5hrs prior to the "We've been hacked"
4. Some people are claiming they're moving funds to cold storage when Malware is currently active: https://imgur.com/BYM0rMb (Current time is 3:00 AM EDT)
5. As seen in point 4. There's still malware on the github repo as of 03:00 AM EDT UTC-5 2022-12-11 
6. With the malware online for well over 2hrs at the time of writing and the funds being moved whist there's still an active infection is just bad security at it's finest.


Regardless Binance Has pulled out of the potential Buyout of FTX citing 'American Agents' assume this isn't an hack but an elaborte and poorly execuded Exit-Scam/Rug Pull. No other previous Attack on exchanges has had the use of malware or was followed bankrupcy after a leak of interal documents showcasing a business which is supposed to be unaffilated being affilated with said cryptocurrency exchange. Mt. Gox, Coinbase and several others haven't had this problem so what's the difference? 2d ago there's bankrupcy filings... today there's a hack? WTF.
