# PGP Keys

Ah Yes after fucking up my repo I purged and made a completely fresh updated post regarding "Keys" so these are the public & private PGP Keys of top or notorious criminals as time goes on I'll also begin scraping markets on tor for PGP Keys so there's a database of easy to access and study for those in places where Tor or I2P are not availble for good or bad reasons. I am not going to dive into politics. I'll be updating this and producing bots as time goes forward for now we only have 1 key dump.

If a key contains a secret / private key it'll have 2 sections per readme.md or txt file.

Which will look like this:

# Public Key
[INSERT PUBLIC PGP KEY HERE]

# Private Key
[Insert Private PGP Key Here]

Most will be public keys and all will be cataorized by where they were obtined from.
