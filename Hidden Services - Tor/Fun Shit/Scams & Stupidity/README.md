This is a work in progress, Currently there's no "Visable Folders" but they do exist. These will be catagorized so you'll always have fun times ruining someone's day:

- Hitman Services
- Firearm, Explosives, Ammo Sites
- Poisons
- Hacking Services
- Malware & Botnets
- Marketplaces 
- Harvested Credentials & Email Addresses
- Random IPs
- Directories & Server info
- /WP-FAILS
- Name & Shame (For the worst of the worst, will contain offsite links in a txt file).
- Path Traversal & Vulns
- Pictures of criminals
- FBI, Euro/Interpol's Most wanted list


All these are filled with scams, stupidity and more
